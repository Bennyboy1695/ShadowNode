	"content": "The image banners at the top of the page are refered to as \u0026ldquo;bigimg\u0026rdquo; in this theme. They are optional, and one more more can be specified. If more than one is specified, the images rotate every 10 seconds. In the front matter, bigimgs are specified using an array of hashes.\nA single bigimg can be specified in the front matter by the following YAML:\nbigimg: [{src: \u0026quot;/img/triangle.jpg\u0026quot;, desc: \u0026quot;Triangle\u0026quot;}]\rMultiple bigimgs can be specified in the front matter by the following YAML:\nbigimg: [{src: \u0026quot;/img/triangle.jpg\u0026quot;, desc: \u0026quot;Triangle\u0026quot;}, {src: \u0026quot;/img/sphere.jpg\u0026quot;, desc: \u0026quot;Sphere\u0026quot;}, {src: \u0026quot;/img/hexagon.jpg\u0026quot;, desc: \u0026quot;Hexagon\u0026quot;}]\rAlso note that the description field is optional, and images could instead be specified by:\nbigimg: [{src: \u0026quot;/img/triangle.jpg\u0026quot;}, {src: \u0026quot;/img/sphere.jpg\u0026quot;}, {src: \u0026quot;/img/hexagon.jpg\u0026quot;}]\rThe above YAML array of hashes were written in \u0026ldquo;flow\u0026rdquo; style. However when generating a new page or post with hugo new post/mypost.md, hugo may interpret the archetype for bigimg in the default YAML style. Defining multiple bigimg's complete with descriptions in this style would be specified by:\nbigimg: - {src: \u0026quot;/img/triangle.jpg\u0026quot;, desc: \u0026quot;Triangle\u0026quot;}\r- {src: \u0026quot;/img/sphere.jpg\u0026quot;, desc: \u0026quot;Sphere\u0026quot;}\r- {src: \u0026quot;/img/hexagon.jpg\u0026quot;, desc: \u0026quot;Hexagon\u0026quot;}\rAdditional information can be found in this YAML tutorial.\n"

It supports displayed math using the $$ or \\\\[...\\\\] delimiters, like this:\nFormula 1: $$ \\phi = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{5})}{2} = 1.6180339887\\cdots $$\nFormula 2: (same formula, different delimiter) \\[ \\phi = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{5})}{2} = 1.6180339887\\cdots \\]\nAdditional details can be found on GitHub or on the Wiki.\nExample 1 If the text between $$ contains newlines it will rendered in display mode:\n$$\rf(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\hat f(\\xi)\\,e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\\,d\\xi\r$$\r$$ f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\hat f(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x},d\\xi $$\nExample 2 $$\r\\frac{1}{\\Bigl(\\sqrt{\\phi \\sqrt{5}}-\\phi\\Bigr) e^{\\frac25 \\pi}} = 1+\\frac{e^{-2\\pi}} {1+\\frac{e^{-4\\pi}} {1+\\frac{e^{-6\\pi}} {1+\\frac{e^{-8\\pi}} {1+\\cdots} } } }\r$$\r$$ \\frac{1}{\\Bigl(\\sqrt{\\phi \\sqrt{5}}-\\phi\\Bigr) e^{\\frac25 \\pi}} = 1+\\frac{e^{-2\\pi}} {1+\\frac{e^{-4\\pi}} {1+\\frac{e^{-6\\pi}} {1+\\frac{e^{-8\\pi}} {1+\\cdots} } } } $$\nExample 3 $$\r1 + \\frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\\cdots = \\prod_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})}, \\quad\\quad \\text{for }\\lvert q\\rvert\u0026lt;1.\r$$\r$$ 1 + \\frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\\cdots = \\prod_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})}, \\quad\\quad \\text{for }\\lvert q\\rvert\u0026lt;1. $$\nExample 4 Remember, certain characters are rendered by markdown, so you may need to workaround those issues.

	"content": "Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? If I bought a bag of peanuts and had an allergic reaction, no one would fault me if I threw it out. If I ended a relationship with a woman who hit me, no one would say that I had a commitment problem. But if I walk away from a seemingly secure route because my soul has other ideas, I am a flake?\nThe truth is that no one else can definitively know the path we are here to walk. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for the omnipotent other—but unless they are genuine psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they’ve actually done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they cannot genuinely know anyone else’s. Only soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.\nAt the heart of the struggle are two very different ideas of success—survival-driven and soul-driven. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, the nourishing of the soul be damned. It is an odd and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they love the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They have already played the worldly game in previous lives and they search for more subtle shades of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they really are the truest warriors.\nA soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul step, however unsightly it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and misguided for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it may stifle the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worthwhile if the soul demands it. It is an essential failure if you are called to be a monastic this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul toward its innate image, then so be it. Flake it till you make it.\n"

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th\u0026rsquo; oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th\u0026rsquo; unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprise of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action. \u0026ndash; Soft you now, The fair Ophelia! \u0026ndash; Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered.\n"

	"content": "From Wikipedia:\nAssociation football, more commonly known as football or soccer,[2] is a sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.[3][4][5][6] The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.\nThe goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and then only in their penalty area. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may use their head or torso to strike the ball instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time and/or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA; French: Fédération Internationale de Football Association) which organises a World Cup every four years.[7]\n"

For example a normal member gets only 1 home. See Ranks for more info!\n/sethome [name] [-o] Sets your home at a current location. Failure to specify a name will set the home under the name home. Adding -o to the end of your command will override the location of the previous home (e.g /sethome home -o will make your new home at the location you're currently at).\n/home \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Teleports your to the specified home. Failure to specify a home name will default to home.\n/delhome \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Deletes the specific home. Failure to specify a name will result in command failure.\n/homes Lists all set homes. Clicking on a home will teleport you to that home. Any home marked in a red colour is unable to be teleported to, due to it being in an unsafe condition.\n Teleportation /tpa \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Sends a request to teleport to the specified player. The player may respond to the request or ignore it.\n/tpyes Accepts the most recent teleport request you've received. You are also able to press Accept in the message to accept the teleport request.\n/tpno Denies the most recent teleport request you've received. You are also able to press Deny in the message to deny the teleport request.\n/tpahere \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Sends a request to the specified player to teleport to your location. Requires the rank of Shade or higher.\n/tptoggle Toggles players being able to send you teleport requests. By default, all requests are enabled.\n/rtp Teleports you to a random location in the same dimension after a short delay. Locations may include deep in a cave or in the middle of the ocean. Costs 100 in-game dollars to reduce spam.\n/spawn Will teleport you to the servers spawn point.\n Chat /msg \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;message\u0026gt; Sends your message privately to the specified user.\n/r \u0026lt;message\u0026gt; Replies with your message to the last person who messaged you.\n/gignore add \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Ignores specified player's chat globally. We recommend doing this command in the lobbies as the specified user needs to have joined your server previously.\n/gignore remove \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Stop ignoring chat from the player. We recommend running this in the lobbies.\n/gignore list Lists every player you have currently got ignored. We recommend running this in the lobbies.\n/channel \u0026lt;local|global\u0026gt; Global will send all your messages to the entire network, This is default. Local will send your messages to only your server. Users in other servers will not be able to see your chat, yet you will see theirs. Discord is not effected by these commands.\n Island/Cave Area Any server that is a skyblock style or uses a predefined starting area will use this plugin to create your area. Along with the commands mentioned above, there are a few more commands for your island/cave.\nServers that fit into this category are servers like: Stoneblock, SkyFactory, Glacial Awakening.\n/area create Creates an area and automatically sets the area spawn point. This command wipes your inventory.\n/area spawn [name] [-f] Teleports you to the specified users island. Leaving the name blank will teleport you to your area. If you accompany the command with the -f flag it will force you to your area's spawn point even if the server deems it unsafe!\n/area setspawn \u0026lt;-o\u0026gt; Changes the area spawn point location to where you are currently standing. Make sure its not on slabs, as the plugin will see them as unsafe!\n/area reset Wipes your area and starts your progress over fresh.\n/area info Provides information regarding the area you are currently in.\n/area list Provides a list of all the areas on the server.\n/area lock Locks down your area preventing any uninvited members from entering.\n/area unlock Unlocks your area, allowing all members of the server access to enter.\n/area expand Expands your area's claim. Default size is 256x256, max size is 400x400.\n/area setbiome \u0026lt;biome\u0026gt; Changes your area's biome.\n/area invite \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Invites the player to build and play with you. They must set their own home in your area or use the /area spawn [name] command. This does not remove a previous area which the user has created.\n/area leave Removes your access to the area you are standing in, if you've been previously invited.\n/area kick \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Revoke all permissions of the player in your area.\n Grief Prevention All these commands will work for subdivided claims as well\n/claimsinfo Checks information of the claim such as trusted players or who owns the claim.\n/claimslist Displays a list of all your claims.\n/permissiontrust \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Allows the user to trust others and run claim commands in the claim your are currently standing in.\n/trust \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Allows the user to build in the claim you are currently standing in, access chests and other inventories.\n/containertrust \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Allows the user to access chests, farm crops, tame/kill animals, the use of a bed, and the use of levers/buttons/pressure plates in the claim you are currently standing in.\n/accesstrust \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Allows the user to access your bed and inventories like an anvil for the claim you're standing in.\n/untrust \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Revokes all permissions for the user for the claim you're currently standing in.\n/untrustall \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; Revokes all permissions for the user in all your claims.\n/trustlist Displays a list of claims that you are trusted in.\n/abandonclaim Removes the claim you are currently standing in.\n/abandonallclaims Removes all your claims.\n Miscellaneous Commands These are the commands that don't really fit into any section.\n/banneditems This command will list all the items that have been banned from being used/placed/crafted/broken ingame because of certain reasons.\nTo navigate through its pages follow the command below unless your on vanilla or infinity in which case the command is /banneditems [-p number]\n/page \u0026lt;next|prev|number\u0026gt; This command is used by a few plugins that send messages with multiple pages. For example if you run /banneditems it will most likely return you a message that at the bottom say 1/9, this means it has 9 pages and you can rotate through those page using this command!\nNote: On servers like infinity and vanilla this command does not exist!\n/server \u0026lt;name\u0026gt; This command will put you on the server you specify. Note: You still need that version/modpack You can also run /name replacing name with the server name for the same effect!\n"

There are two types of Chunk Loaders, Always On and Online Only. To view chunk borders, hit F3+g\nThe most basic command in the plugin is /betterchunkloader, or just /bcl for short. Executing this command will open an interface in the chat that the user may interact with. The interface will contain a list of active chunk loaders you currently own, along with some user-friendly icons. An example of the interface is below. Always On vs Online Only Always On is a chunk loader which is online 24/7 and will keep the chunk loaded. However, the chunk loader will stop loading the chunk after 3 days of activity. Once the owner returns, it will resume loading the chunk.The Online Only chunk loader will only load the chunk when the owner of the loader is online.\nChecking Your Balance To check the number of chunks you may use/have used, you can click the Balance or run /bcl bal. The interface will state the number of both Always Online and Online Only chunks that are currently active (used) and are available. How to Create Chunk Loaders From the main interface, you should click the Create icon or run /bcl create to begin the process of creating a Chunk Loader. An interface will open and should look like the following image. The interface will state the name of the chunk loader Owner. It will also give you the coordinates of the chunk that you are currently standing in. Please note that these coordinates are different than regular XYZ coordinates. To create an Always Online chunk loader or Online Only chunk loader, click their respective icons. You should be prompted with the following interface. The Radius icons will determine the size of the chunk loader. You can only load as many chunks as your balance allows. Hovering over the icon will display how many chunks will be loaded with each radius upgrade. After you select your radius size, your chunk loader will be created. You will be shown a confirmation window which will display your name, loader id, and state. If you'd like to delete your loader and regain your chunk balance, click the Delete icon. How to View Active Chunk Loaders Once you have Chunk Loaders active, running /bcl will contain some information regarding regarding your active chunk loaders. You can hover over the Chunk icon to view the coordinates of the chunk loader. Clicking View will pull up the same prompt that was displayed after you created your loader originally. How to Read Chunk Coordinates To view the coordinates of the chunk you are currently in, press F3. You will see the typical statistics of your game, which should resemble the image below. The value in the red box is your chunk coordinates.  Claiming All of our servers use the latest Grief Prevention plugin for claiming.\nHow to Claim To claim you can either use a Golden Shovel you make, or one provide to you when you first join the server (some servers do not start with the golden shovel or have had their claim tool changed). Every block claimed is accounted for. You can buy claim blocks from the tokenshop, or from the store. Before claiming any land, please make sure to check which method of claiming you currently are using, 2D or 3D. Once your method of choice is confirmed, we can begin claiming. If you are in 2D mode, right click two opposite corners of the intended claim. For 3D mode, right click two opposite corners, one at the lowest point in the claim, and the other at the highest point in the claim. You can right click the air or ground with a stick to see who claims the block you are looking at.\n2D vs 3D 2D means that no what Y level you claim the blocks on, Grief Prevention will make your claim from bedrock to make build level. 3D will require you to claim your area in a cube and will only claim what is inside the cube.\nHow to Subdivide Claims Subdividing your claim means making smaller sections in the bigger claim to allow people to build/access certain parts of your base. To subdivide claims, hold your golden shovel and run the command subdivideclaims. This changes your golden shovel to create smaller claims. This is always in 2D mode, but it reaches to the highest level of your main claim. When you select two corners you see iron blocks instead of golden blocks. To get out of subdivideclaims mode, scroll your mouse wheel off the golden shovel and then back onto it. This can be used to make towns and/or sell plots to other players for in-game currency.\n Crates We use a plugin called HuskyCrates to manage our crates. Crates contain items, the quality of which depends on the tier of the crate. To open a create you must hold the crate key in your hand and right click the corresponding crate. You can obtain crate keys by either purchasing them from our store, or buy buying them in our token shop. This spreadsheet shows everything you can get from crates. It's listed by crate tier and mod. Some items on this list may not be on your server as some modpacks don't have all the mods as others.\n MultiMC MultiMC is a Minecraft launcher. It can be used to launch vanilla Minecraft, custom modpacks, or regular modpacks. The launcher is very good for Linux users or those who don't like the Twitch Launcher. We strongly recommend this launcher.\nHow to Install  Head to MultiMC and select which software is most appropriate for you. Locate the downloaded zip file and export it into a folder.   On most machines, you can right click the folder, click export files and select your destination. If your machine does not have this option, head to Google!  Open the MultiMC folder generated at the location specified during export and double click the MultiMC executable. Complete the final setup details that it asks for, such as your preferred language and java version.  Login to your Profile  Click Profiles at the top Click Manage Accounts in the dropdown Click Add on the right side and fill out the request information  Allocate More Ram This must be done before setting up an instance\n Click the settings, found at the top of your toolbar Head to Java on the left side Under the memory section you will be able to change your minimum and maximum allocation   We do not suggest going above 8192mb 6144mb is the average selection for 1.12+  Setup an Instance With Link  Copy the link address from the modpack download page In MultiMC, select the white blank paper at the top that says Add Instance Check the box next to Import Modpack (local file or link) Paste your link into the text box below Enter the name of the modpack Click on the instance and launch  To update you must reinstall the new update in the same manor as you downloaded the pack oringinally. Remember to save any world files for single player worlds.\nWith Zip  Download a zip file of the modpack from the modpack download page In MultiMC, select the white blank paper at the top that says Add Instance Check the box next to Import Modpack (local file or link) Click the 3 dots and locate your zip Once located, click ok Launch and enjoy  Archive Cannot find instance.cfg Ensure that you are running a version higher than or equal to 0.6.0. You can find your version at the top of the launcher toolbar. If your version is not higher than or equal to 0.6.0, follow this tutorial\nAdding Java Arguments  Locate the Settings tab at the top of the toolbar Click Java on the left side Locate JVM Arguments in the Java Runtime section Fill in your desired arguments in the blank Click test to verify everything is working properly.

	"content": " Rules Store Policies  ShadowNode was created in 2014 by our owner ShadowKitten. Aiming to provide players with the best experience possible, ShadowNode is proud to host over 15 diverse servers!\nRules These rules apply for our Forums, Discord, servers and all other services. By using our services, you are agreeing to follow these rules. Ignorance of these rules is not an excuse. Staff are provided with a general guideline of punishments for each rule, however choose a punishment is at their discretion.\nRespect Staff and Staff Decisions  Do not in any way mock, abuse, argue with, or be disrespectful in general to any member of our staff. If you feel you have been mistreated by a staff member or believe a punishment you received is unjust, do not mock them or make a scene. Contact another member of the staff team to discuss the issue privately.  No Harassment, Flaming or Trolling  This includes repeated requests for something over DMs, frequent unwanted TPA requests, bullying someone in server chat or DMs, and any other kind of unwanted contact or abuse. We understand that friends may joke around with each other, but if a staff member asks you to stop, you should listen. Any joking around that includes cussing, vulgar sexual comments or hate speech will be punished as such.  No Foul Language, Hate Speech, Sexual Comments,Political/Religious Discussions, Drug Use Discussions  We want to provide a safe, positive and clean environment for everyone, so we have this rule to achieve that goal. Private conversations via whispers of this nature are allowed, provided one person is not harassing the other. Discussing ANY topic which talks about abusing drugs, whether they're legal drugs or illegal drugs, is not allowed.  No Advertising, Spamming or Attention-Seeking  This includes advertising other servers or Discords, spamming random stuff in chat, or just general spamming to get attention for something, such as trying to sell something. Bear in mind, that asking for the same thing every few minutes DOES count as spamming.  No Excessive Mobs/Items Inside Mob Spawners  Spawners MUST auto-kill mobs as soon as they spawn. You are NOT allowed to have a spawner which requires a player to kill the mobs inside. Spawners must NOT clog with mobs or items. It is your responsibility to ensure that this doesn't happen.  No Cheating, Hacking, Glitching, Duping  This includes using third-party programs, plugins and/or bugs to gain an unfair advantage in gameplay over other players. X-Ray bugs/resource packs are not allowed. Optifine, BetterFPS and similar framerate-boosting mods ARE allowed, but may cause technical issues with your Minecraft client.  No Begging From Staff Members Our staff members have access to Creative mode to deal with technical issues and discover bugs, not to give you free stuff. See the Refunds policy if you've lost something due to a glitch/bug\nNo Alt Accounts, Using Another User's Account  Alt accounts, by definition, are other accounts that a player has access to. Alt accounts are often used to circumvent punishments that the staff have placed upon a different account. If you allow someone to use your account, and the account is banned, we will not lift the ban. You are responsible for your own account and anyone you let onto the account.  Don't Minimod - Let Staff Do Their Jobs  Mini-modding is telling people what the rules are and what they should do without first consulting staff to see if it is okay to tell those people. You may only teach other users about the rules if a staff member has explicitly given you permission to do so. If a user is asking about rules and no staff member is around to assist them, you may link them to this page.  Do Not Evade Our AFK Timer, Modifications or Limitations   Evading the AFK Timer includes, but is not limited to:\n Any item, machine, third-party program, or building which would cause the AFK detection system to not kick you while you are away from your computer.    Evading Modifications/Limitations includes, but is not limited to:\n Breaking blocks in areas you are not supposed to be able to modify, bypassing the profanity filter, and the use of banned items.    If you are a designated tester for the server, then this is allowed only while staff are present and watching\n  No Refunds of Items Lost, Unless the Loss of Items was Caused by a Proven Glitch with Our Services  We do not refund items lost to graves failing to spawn, clicking the Baubles menu with an item by accident, accidentally throwing an item in a Trash Can, or any similar issue. These are mod bugs and user error, neither of which we are responsible for. We do not refund items lost in unclaimed bases being raided or griefed. You are responsible for securing your own base. WE will use Prism to roll back/undo the damage, but that is all we will do. We do not refund easy-to-replace items such as sand, wood, dirt, Oak Fence, etc. Staff will decide on a case-by-case basis if an item should be refunded.  Do Not Auto-mine in the Overworld  We have mining worlds for a reason, so the terrain of the overworld doesn't get scarred by constant mining with Quarries or other mass-mining devices. If a quarry or quarry-like device is found in the overworld, it will be broken by a staff member. You may use a Quarry and/or similar devices for clearing space during base-building. 2x2 chunks maximum, with a 20 Y-level maximum.  Use English Only in the Main Chat  This is purely to help the staff troubleshoot thing sand keep the chat clear of confusing messages. Talking in other langues via private messages is allowed.  No Griefing  Griefing means to negatively change a building or area which you do not own or have permission to use. This includes, but is not limited to the following:  Breaking blocks from other's builds, stealing items or resources from others. This also applies to buildings and areas where the area is player owner, but it is not evident who exactly owned it.    No raiding or Stealing, Even if the Base is Unclaimed  Includes all resource types.  Mana, power and livestock are also considered resources.    Do Not Use Discord to Evade Mute Punishments  If a staff member mutes you, it's for a reason. Don't use our Discord services to bypass our punishment. Using the ban appeals forum to discuss your mute is allowed.  Do Not Impersonate a Staff Member  Impersonation means pretending to be someone else. This includes changing your nickname to a staff member's username/nickname or adding Staff/Admin/Etc to nay part of your nickname or rank.   Store Policies These policies apply for all purchases to ShadowNode and services or goods provided by ShadowNode. Punishments may include forfeiting of product or perks without refund permanently or for a given time.\nAll Transactions are Final  This means that you will not get any refunds for purchases, regardless of the circumstances, as you should've read what you wil be getting in depth in the first place.  No Abuse of a Product or its Perks  If you abuse any store items/ranks/privileges you will be subject to punishment without refund.  No Chargebacks  Chargebacks are when a customer reverses a transaction which has already been processed, usually done when goods are defective and therefore return the goods with a refund. As we do not do refunds here due to the digital nature of the services we provide, any chargebacks aimed at our services will be treated as an effort to defraud us.  No Purchases from Unconfirmed or Unauthorized Accounts  Purchases from unconfirmed accounts are not allowed. If a purchase was made from an account you are not authorized to use, the owner may contact us by email at payments@shadownode.ca to discuss refund. Once an account holder has contacted us and has been verified as the legitimate owner, we will terminate the account associated with the payment and they will be unable to access our services permanently.
